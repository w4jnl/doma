# Changelog

User-facing changes per release, newest first. `scripts/release.sh` refuses to tag a version
that has no section here and uses the section as the GitHub release notes, so every release
updates this file first. Dates are the tag dates.

## Unreleased

- **The server, phase 0.** `doma serve` with `doma.toml` and `DOMA_*` overrides; the setup page
  that shows once; households with their default list and first home; the owner invite as a QR;
  invites and roles; device keys with a signature on every app request; `POST /sync/v1` with
  cursors, paging and snapshots; the fold that gives the same tables in any order of events, with
  the fixture the apps share; nightly snapshots and retention; the export zip; silent push behind
  `push.enabled` with the APNs key encrypted at rest; the admin pages (households, devices,
  quotas, export, backup, log level, a second step on sign-in); guest links and the guest view.
  The apps are next.
